# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- Split out of [composite-laminate-fea](https://github.com/samhughes-fea/composite-laminate-fea)
  with its history. The package was `blade_geometry_model` there and is now
  `implicit_geometry_kernel`.
- `BladeGeometry` lofts any of the 40 layouts along the span; `section_at(z)` returns
  the wall midlines, thicknesses, labels and cells; `SectionCut.mid_surface()` gives the
  wall graph that the laminate and section models build on.
- Flapwise (`-F`) webs stay normal to the rotor plane under twist.
- Forked from blade-structure: `section_geometry`, `section_contract`,
  `coordinate_frames`, `area_2d` and `shoelace_integration`.
